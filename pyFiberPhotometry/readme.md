# pyPhotoPhotometry
This folder contains work relating to the development of code for exploratory data analysis of fiber photometry data. Experimental data is typically ratiometric fluorescence imaging of GCaMP6f in neurons.]

## Experiment
A 300 micron slice is placed in the chamber with continuously flowing ACSF. A fluorescent field (GCaMP6f+) is identified and the tip if the post is lowered to contact those cells. Fiber recordings then are taken with all regular microscopy illumination off.
